Full Information Maximum Likelihood for Python
----------------------------------------------

   This is a Python/NumPy implementation of full information maximum
   likelihood (FIML) method to estimate the mean and the covariance of
   data with missing values.

Prerequisites
-------------

   NumPy and SciPy are required to run this software.

Caveats
-------

   The input data must not contain linearly dependent variables.
